# Quantitative Market Analysis Project

## Overview
Analyzing systematic relationships between equity indices (S&P, NASDAQ) and commodity/currency markets (gold, oil, copper, natural gas, cattle, FX).

## Folder Structure
- `/data`: Raw market data
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with quantitative analysis
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for helper functions
- `/results`: Analysis outputs and visualizations

## Key Analytical Methods:
- Cointegration & correlation analysis
- Granger causality tests
- Regression modeling and scenario simulations

## Tools Used
- Python (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `yfinance`, `scikit-learn`)
- Jupyter Notebooks & VSCode

## Goals
- Clearly define market dynamics and predictive relationships.
- Provide actionable quantitative insights.
- Demonstrate quantitative rigor aligned with Bridgewater‚Äôs macro-systematic philosophy.

### üêÑ **Strategic Interpretation of Dividend-Adjusted Cattle Returns vs. Equities**

**Explicit Dividend Definition & Context:**  
In this analysis, the revenue explicitly derived from a spring-calving cow-calf operation ($444 per cow annually as per the UKY Agricultural Economics analysis) is treated explicitly as an operational "dividend yield," providing a real-world proxy for consistent annual income. 

To remain explicitly conservative, this analysis **does not include** potentially significant revenue streams from higher-value products such as artisan cheeses, yogurt, and leather goods‚Äîrevenues which could substantially increase the dividend yield and overall returns.

### üìà **Risk-Adjusted Return Analysis (Sharpe-like Ratios)**
Comparing cattle farming explicitly adjusted for "operational dividends" against dividend-adjusted returns of major equity indices:

- **Live Cattle Dividend Adjusted Returns** explicitly show consistently superior risk-adjusted returns compared to both the NASDAQ100 and S&P 500, demonstrating:
  - **Higher Annual Returns:** Driven explicitly by stable operational "dividend" yields.
  - **Lower Volatility:** Relative stability explicitly due to the underlying real asset (livestock), as opposed to equities heavily influenced by market sentiment, macroeconomic shocks, and sector rotations.

This comparison suggests explicitly that on a risk-adjusted basis, cattle farming, when structured as a dividend-yielding asset, can significantly outperform equity indices like the S&P500 and NASDAQ100‚Äîespecially in macroeconomic environments characterized explicitly by volatility, inflation, or uncertainty.

### üßÆ **Why Are We Seeing Such Strong Results?**  

- The high explicit operational dividend yield (from annual cow-calf operations) significantly bolsters cumulative returns over time, acting as a powerful compounded growth driver explicitly in stable and inflationary environments.
- The lower explicit volatility for cattle returns (relative to indices) enhances the risk-adjusted attractiveness, clearly highlighting cattle farming‚Äôs defensive characteristics explicitly.

---

### üìå **Implications for Strategic Asset Allocation:**  

- These findings suggest explicitly that large-scale cattle farming operations could serve as a crucial diversifier and hedge explicitly against macroeconomic and inflationary volatility, potentially strengthening long-term risk-adjusted returns in a diversified portfolio.
- Given conservative explicit assumptions (excluding higher-end revenue streams), the true potential for profitability and risk-adjusted outperformance explicitly may be even higher.

---

### üîë **Strategic Insights & Final Summary:**

- Explicitly integrating operationally driven dividend-like assets (cattle farming) can significantly enhance portfolio efficiency and returns, particularly in environments where traditional asset yields are suppressed or macroeconomic uncertainty is elevated.
- The analysis explicitly underscores the importance of systematically evaluating real asset investments through a quantitative lens of operational dividends, providing deeper insight explicitly into risk-adjusted returns versus traditional equities.
